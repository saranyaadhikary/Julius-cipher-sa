# Julius-cipher-sa
Welcome to the time of Julius Caesar! This project provides a simple yet effective graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting messages using a secret key. The application is built using Python's Tkinter library and utilizes base64 encoding for the encryption and decryption process.

# Project Description
The Cryptography Cipher Project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a base64 encoding scheme. The project demonstrates basic encryption and decryption techniques and provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to enter their text, input a secret key, and see the results of the encryption or decryption process.

# Features
Text Encryption: Users can input a message and encrypt it using a predefined secret key. The encrypted message is displayed in a new window.
Text Decryption: Users can input an encrypted message and decrypt it using the same predefined secret key. The decrypted message is displayed in a new window.
Reset Functionality: Users can reset the input fields to enter a new message and secret key.
User-Friendly Interface: The application has a simple and clean interface with labels, text boxes, and buttons to facilitate easy use.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (included with standard Python distributions)
# Usage
Encryption:

Enter the text you want to encrypt in the text box.
Enter the secret key (default is "1234").
Click the "Encrypt" button to see the encrypted message in a new window.
Decryption:

Enter the encrypted text in the text box.
Enter the secret key (default is "1234").
Click the "Decrypt" button to see the decrypted message in a new window.
Reset:

Click the "Reset" button to clear the text box and the secret key entry.
